Option 3: Work by yourself
This option is only accessible to those who are choosing option 3 above, of a senior thesis/independent project (and who are not comfortable making part of it be group based)
Please choose this option with caution as you will be held to same grading standard as groups of 3-4 
Norms/Expectations
A good team usually involves people from diverse backgrounds because this final project does not only require people who are good at writing Python code but also people who excel at doing research, analysis, interpretation, and data visualization. If you choose your own group, make sure the people in your group are the one that you work best with because you will be spending a lot of time communicating and working together.
If you decide to conduct option 3 and work individually, due to the short and fast pace of the term and the  final project having high standards for its output,, you will likely not have enough time to finish it if you do not already have a project already started so please only choose this option if you have existing thesis/independent project work
