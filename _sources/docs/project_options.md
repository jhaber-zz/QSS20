# Final Project Options

The research process will focus on narrowing down broad questions and using the data to investigate. 

## 1. Social Impact Practicum

With support from the [Dartmouth Center for Social Impact](https://students.dartmouth.edu/social-impact/), one option for your final project is to complete a [Social Impact Practicum](https://students.dartmouth.edu/social-impact/programs-initiatives/students/social-impact-practicums-sips): a chance for you to use your data science skills to help a real-world organization. If you choose this option, you will apply yourself to an important matter of public policy: *how have those with disabilities fared during COVID-19, and what racial inequalities do we see in its impact?*

Your partner and data provider for the Social Impact Practicum would be the START (Systemic, Therapeutic, Assessment, Resources, and Treatment) model advanced at the University of New Hampshire, a comprehensive model of service supporting the optimization of independence, treatment, and community living for individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities (IDD) and mental health needs. For more information, check out the website of [the Center for Start Services](https://centerforstartservices.org/).

Broadly, this option involves two datasets:

- Structured data on patients, their demographics, their disabilities, and interactions with emergency departments and law enforcement
- Unstructured free-text notes on clinical observations; if these are long enough they may me amenable to using NLP to analyze

**This option requires working in a group.**


## 2. Deeper Dive Into Felony Sentencing Data Used in Psets 1 and 2

In the first two problem sets, you have used and familiarized yourself with the Cook County State Attorney’s Office Felony Sentencing Data to investigate the following topics in a preliminary fashion:

- Racial disparities in incarceration versus probation
- Racial disparities in the sentence length
- Within-judge disparities

In this option, you’d do a more rigorous/deeper dive into a question that uses the felony sentencing data.

There are many more questions this data can be used to answer, including: 

1. more rigorous analyses of the above questions that use techniques from causal inference
2. analyses of other fields in the data (e.g., neighborhood disparities; across-judge disparities; how judge demographics relate to sentencing behavior)

**This option requires working in a group.**


## 3. Use Senior Thesis/Independent Project 

If you're already pursuing a significant research project, you may use this course to advance an existing work in progress, covering parts and analysis you might not include otherwise. necessarily have time to finish for their thesis and project.

The project needs to align with the [evaluation criteria]() — e.g., it must result in data you can share with us, a repo you can share, and a 10-page CS-style report.

**You can complete this option either individually or in a group** (i.e., by focusing on one person’s project and getting group help).
