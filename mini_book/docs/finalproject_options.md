# Project Options

You will select one of three options for your final project:


## 1. Social Impact Practicum topic: Training medical students to work with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD)

With support from the [Dartmouth Center for Social Impact](https://students.dartmouth.edu/social-impact/), one option for your final project is to complete a [Social Impact Practicum](https://students.dartmouth.edu/social-impact/programs-initiatives/students/social-impact-practicums-sips): a chance for you to use your data science skills to help a real-world organization. If you choose this option, you will apply yourself to an important issue in public health: *How do medical professionals interact with patients with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD), and how can medical student training improve this?*

Your partner and data provider for the Social Impact Practicum will be the National Center for START Services (NCSS) at the Institute on Disability at University of New Hampshire (UNH). The START (Systemic, Therapeutic, Assessment, Resources, and Treatment) model advanced at UNH is a comprehensive model of service supporting the optimization of independence, treatment, and community living for individuals with IDD and mental health needs. You can find more information about the Center for Start Services [here](https://centerforstartservices.org/) and [here](https://iod.unh.edu/projects/center-start-services).

Here is more information from the project partner:

> As part of a strategic initiative to develop best practices for prescribers who work with patients with IDD and mental health concerns (IDD_MH), NCSS/UNH has begun piloting training content with medical students (residents, fellows and second/third year medical students) at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, the medical school and the University of Puerto Rico, and Franklin Pierce University’s Physician Assistant Program.  This includes a 6 hours of trainings based on the recently published [Integrated Mental Health Treatment Guidelines for Prescribers in Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities](https://centerforstartservices.org/IDD-MH-Prescribing-Guidelines) as well as pre- and post-evaluation data.

> The START program at UNH would like students of QSS 20 to analyze this training evaluation data to assess strengths and growth points as well as recommend changes based on the data which could improve efficacy, retention, impact, or all of the above.  (For example, the training videos which include the lived experience of individuals are already scoring higher, so that is one already-identified place where small changes to the content delivery medium could improve results).

> At present (Fall 2022), there are 200+ evaluations of 40+ medical students, and by November we expect this number to grow to 300+ evaluations from 60+ distinct medical students.

In the coming weeks, I will work with the project partner to develop a few broad questions for investigation by student groups who choose this option.

**This option requires working in a group.**


## 2. Deeper dive into problem set data

In the first two problem sets, you will use and familiarize yourself with a real-world data source I am finalizing. In this option, you’d do a more rigorous/deeper dive into a question that uses this data. More info on this soon. 

**This option requires working in a group.**


## 3. Use Senior Thesis/independent project 

If you're already pursuing a significant research project, you may use this course to advance an existing work in progress, covering parts and analysis you might not include otherwise. 

The project needs to align with the [evaluation criteria](https://github.com/jhaber-zz/QSS20_public/blob/main/finalproj_guidelines/final_project_rubric.csv) — e.g., it must result in data you can share with us, a repo you can share, and a 10-page CS-style report.

Please choose this option with caution as you will be held to same grading standard as groups of 3-4. Moreover, unless you have already made substantial progress on an independent project, you probably won't be able to finish it in one short quarter.

**You can complete this option either individually or in a group** (i.e., by focusing on one person’s project and getting group help).
