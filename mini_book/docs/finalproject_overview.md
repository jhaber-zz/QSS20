# Final Project Overview

The final research project is the cornerstone achievement of this course. You will select a data source to investigate, begin with broad questions, and focus on narrowing these down to complete and clearly explain a scientific investigation that applies the programming skills we've developed.

Your final project will produce three outputs: a status update presentation (on the last day of class), a scientific report (\~10 pages), and a well-documented GitHub repository. You will also complete two project milestones in the second half of the quarter, for which you'll be assigned into groups of 3-4 students. You'll work from a common repository that you'll be added to, and have push/commit privileges for, when you're set up on GitHub.


## Options for forming groups

You will have three options to form final project groups of 3-4 students (we'll ask you about your preferences later). Note that these groups need not be the same ones you had for your final project milestones.

1. Choose your own groups 
    - Keep in mind complementary skillsets as well as people you like, given how much time you will spend communicating and working together. This project calls for not only people skilled at writing Python code, but also people who excel at doing research, analysis, interpretation, and data visualization. In other words, diversity helps any team.
2. Opt into group matching (or recruit 1-2 more)
    - We will account for your matching preferences and restrictions
3. Work alone on a significant, independent project (e.g., Senior Thesis)
    - See the Final Project Components page for more info on this option.
